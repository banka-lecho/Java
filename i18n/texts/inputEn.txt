The savannah monitor is the most common monitor lizard species available in the pet trade, accounting for almost half
(48.0552%) of the entire international trade in live monitor lizards. [16] Despite its prevalence in global pet trade,
successful captive reproduction is very rare, and a high mortality rate is associated with the species. [17]
Adult specimens frequently become unwanted pets and are reported as being the most common monitor lizards by animal
rescue agencies. The skins are traded within the international leather trade and originate mainly from Chad, Mali
and Sudan.

V. exanthematicus is listed as least concern by IUCN.[1] The species is hunted for its leather and meat, and for the
international pet trade. The trade in wild collected savannah monitors is not of a global conservation concern, due
to the vast range of the species; in addition to the collection for the pet trade often occurring over a relatively
small area.[19] An average of 30,574 live specimens were imported into the US each year, between 2000 and 2009;
total imports of live specimens into the US between 2000 and 2010 was 325,480 animals. During the same period,
1,037 skins, shoes, and products of the species were imported into the US. Trade in live animals comes mainly from
Ghana (235,903 animals exported between 2000 and 2010), Togo (188,110 animals exported between 2000 and 2010),
and Benin (72,964 animals exported between 2000 and 2010). During the same period, total worldwide declared exports
of skins and products of the species totalled 37,506.[20] However, substantial undeclared trade in the species occurs
from Sudan, Nigeria, and elsewhere.[1] Within several West African nations, roadside diners and food stands specialize
in “monitor stew”, a hot simmered dish of local vegetables and savannah monitor; it is unclear whether the cooked
lizards are hunted or bred specifically for human consumption, or at what rate they are being killed for this
purpose.[21]
